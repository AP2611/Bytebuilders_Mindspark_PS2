# 🧠 Bytebuilders PS2 Solution — COEP Mindspark 2025

Welcome to our **Bytebuilders PS2** submission for **COEP Mindspark 2025**!  
This project demonstrates our implementation and solution for the given problem statement, leveraging **AI/ML** techniques powered by **Hugging Face** models.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1️⃣ Clone this Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bytebuilders-ps2.git
cd bytebuilders-ps2
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Get Your Hugging Face Token
You’ll need a personal **Hugging Face access token** to use certain models or APIs.

👉 Get your token from: [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

Once you have it, paste it in your environment as follows:
```bash
export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```
or on Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
setx HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN "your_token_here"
```

Alternatively, you can paste your token directly in the code (not recommended for security reasons).

## 🧩 Running the Project
Once your environment is ready, simply run:
```bash
python main.py
```

Depending on your solution type, the script will:
- Load your Hugging Face model or pipeline
- Process the input data
- Generate the required output or predictions

## 💡 Notes
- Ensure that your **Hugging Face token** has proper permissions (read access to models).
- For restricted models, you must accept the model license on Hugging Face before using it.
- If you face rate-limit or authentication issues, try regenerating your token.
